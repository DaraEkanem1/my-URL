    <h2>🌟 About Us</h2>
    <p>Dara and Etima met at school and instantly clicked. Ever since, they've been a duo—through laughter, serious chats, and unforgettable adventures.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
  <h2>🌟 About Dara</h2>
  <p>
    Dara is the kind of friend who brings the vibes, the snacks, and a suspicious number of perfectly-timed dad jokes.
    He’s got a heart bigger than his outfit collection and a talent for making Etima laugh even when she claims she's "done with humans."
    Whether he's solving math like a wizard, designing websites that scream friendship goals, or showing up with gifts that belong in rom-coms,
    Dara's friendship is basically premium—like Wi-Fi that never lags.
  </p>

<div class="section">
  <h2>🌼 About Etima</h2>
  <p>
    Etima may be fun-sized, but her personality is anything but small.
    She’s the friend who can go from sage advice to chaotic giggles in 0.3 seconds.
    Her hugs defy physics, her comebacks are elite, and her laugh? Contagious enough to qualify as a superpower.
    She’s graduating, yes—but even in uni, she’ll still be the CEO of Dara’s heart and the founding member of the "Best Friends Forever" board.
    Basically, if awesomeness were measured in centimeters, Etima would break the scale.

  <p>
    So here we are—one website, several memories, and an unshakeable friendship later.
    This page may end, but our story doesn't. You've graduated, but you're not gone.
    You're just on another level now (like a boss battle I’m proud you’ve reached).
    Stay wonderful, stay chaotic, and stay close—I’ll always be here, cheering you on, snack in hand. Bunny's moving on and Teddy's coming soon🥹🤏
